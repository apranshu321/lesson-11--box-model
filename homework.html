        <p div id="box_description">I like to play chess because it takes my mind of the things in life that i don't like
             and  don't want to think about. It lets me immerese myself into a game of strategy and iq where there is no luck involved but pure skill.
             It is also fun to play as you get to use your brain to get elo points that you can flex to your friends about or just use chess into stimulating your brain to work in a way to plan everything in advance
              step by step by training your brain when you have to calculate what move you are going to play and what consiquence it is going to lead to and think of tactics to checkmate your opponent by planning what he and you are going to play to lead to a checkmate and all the possible things that could happen if you were to play a certain move</p>
